    "# Simulating Covid-19 Spread in PySB\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how one can implement and simulate a system model using PySB. In this example, a simple model of Covid-19 spread is simulated. This model can be simulated by solving a system of first order ODEs given by: dy/dt = f(y, t). However, using PySB, the system can be given as a set of reaction rules and the underlying ODE system is solved at runtime. This representation is typically clearer and easier to update and maintain."
